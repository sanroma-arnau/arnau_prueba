# frontend-vonzu-test

## Exercice

At Vonzu Tech. we are releasing a new functionality related with our expeditions.

We need a landing page that given a reference search we display both its expeditions and client information.

## Requirements

### Technical requirements

- You will have to build an web application using React.js framework and typescript.

- You can implement your own CSS or use a UI components library.

- Reference search must be handled by an input.

- The sorting options are up to you, only one is necessary.

- You should spend between 3 and 5 hours working on this.

- We will use the code you deliver to us for the pair programming step of the interview process.

- You will find a `.json` file. You should treat it as if it were returned by an endpoint.

### Technical requirements

- In case we cannot implement all the needs, we would like to know the reason.
- The reference.png is an orientative mockup, you can apply your personal UI, and no icons are necessary.
